## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
- Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
- Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
- View a full-page preview of the formatted content
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - JS library for storing state across the application

### What I learned

Improved my knowledge of React and Redux libraries. Also, found something new about different styles that I can implement in side sections with 'position: absolute' property. There was also one minor difficulty with displaying date in Safari on 'i'-devices, but I smashed that one.

### Useful resources

- [Immer update patterns](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/update-patterns/) - Very helpful resource that you can use to find out how to update your immutable Redux state. Works with only reduxjs/toolkit.
